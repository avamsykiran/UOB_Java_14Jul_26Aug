            platform = Hardware + OS 

            .class is only platform independent
            .jar are also platform independent because they are a pack of .class file only.

    Features and Characteristics

            1. Case Sensitive
            2. A statement can span into any number of lines of code but must be terminated with a ;
            3. Whitespace are ignored
            4. a block of statements should lie in between { and a }

            1. Simple
            2. High Level Strictly but Partially Object Orietned Language
            3. Robust
            4. MultiThreaded
            5. Distributed
            6. Platform Independent
            7. Archetecture Neutral
            8. Self Documented.
